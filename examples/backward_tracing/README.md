# Backward tracing

Examples cover trajectories from a fixed detector, thin-shell source theory and velocity-integrated VDFs. Rm=3390 km. Run commands from the repository root.

## 1. Random-velocity trajectories

![5000 trajectories in XZ](images/probe_backtrace_xz_5000.png)

The detector is at `(0,0,2 Rm)`. Initial speeds are uniform from 10 to 200 km/s, with Vy=0 and uniform directions in XZ. These paths illustrate trajectories without physical source weighting.

```sh
python examples/backward_tracing/plot_probe_backtrace.py
```

The script calls [random_probe_backtrace.jl](random_probe_backtrace.jl). Use `--data outputs/<run_id>/trajectories.jsonl` to replot saved trajectories. See [trajectory settings](probe_backtrace.md).

## 2. Surface source and PSD

The [derivation](backtracing_derivation.md) describes a traversable 400 km source surface and a fixed 200 km absorbing boundary. Each crossing adds `F*g/abs(v dot er)` while volume production continues along the path. Implementation: `src/tracing/detector_psd_backward.jl`; MHD input: `src/data/mhd.jl`.

## 3. Preliminary velocity-integrated VDF

![Preliminary integrated VDF](images/vdf_xz_preliminary.png)

The figure shows `f_xz=integral f dVy` in s² m⁻⁵. The initial grid contains 35,301 trajectories. Velocity-grid and time-step checks have not converged, so this result is not ready for quantitative interpretation. See [preliminary VDF details](vdf_preliminary.md).

```sh
python examples/backward_tracing/plot_probe_vdf.py
```

`data/` contains `vdf.csv`, five check points, refinement results and plotting metadata. Full JLD2 outputs and logs remain local. Recompute in a new directory:

```sh
julia --startup-file=no --threads=4 --project=. examples/backward_tracing/probe_vdf_integrated.jl outputs/probe_vdf_new_run
python examples/backward_tracing/plot_probe_vdf.py outputs/probe_vdf_new_run
```

[check_probe_vdf_grid.jl](check_probe_vdf_grid.jl) reads `qa_points.csv` and evaluates selected points using different Vy spacings and time steps. It requires the same MHD, MAT volume-source and GITM inputs.

## 4. Electric energy gain

![Electric energy gain](images/energy_gain_xz_preliminary.png)

See [definitions and units](energy_gain.md). Convective, Hall and total electric work are saved at each three-dimensional velocity point and averaged over Vy with PSD weights. Positive values indicate net energy gain from the past endpoint to the detector. The velocity grid remains unconverged.

## 5. Local power and cumulative work

![Power and cumulative work](images/probe_path_power_xz_5000.png)

The [path-power example](path_power.md) uses the same 5000 initial conditions. The first row shows local power (eV/s); the second shows work accumulated from the past endpoint (eV). Red indicates gain and blue loss, using a coolwarm symmetric logarithmic scale.

## 6. Tail detector

The [tail example](tail_probe.md) starts 5000 O₂⁺ trajectories at (−2,0,0) Rm, with uniform speeds from 0 to 100 km/s and isotropic three-dimensional directions. It includes trajectory, local-power and cumulative-work figures.

## Dependencies

Use the Julia project environment and Python with NumPy, Matplotlib, h5py and Arial. Mars and empirical boundaries are provided by `src/visualization`, including the bundled Mars image. Physical inputs must be available in `data/`; scripts do not download inputs or install dependencies.
